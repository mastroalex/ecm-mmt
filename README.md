The equivalent circuit model for a parallel electrode impedance cytometer is analyzed together with Maxwell's theory of homogenization of mixtures. It deals with both a modeling single and double shell.

The results show that even small errors in the estimation of the parameters lead to variations in the model predictions. Furthermore, the possibility of differentiating is evident from the modeled signal different biological states at different analysis frequencies.
